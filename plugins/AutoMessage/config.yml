#     Feel free to add color codes by using & in your messages!
#     To split a message onto multiple lines use the \n delimiter!
#     Lines starting with / will be run as a command!
#     To add single apostrophes into a message use ''.
#     For a complete tutorial go to https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/automessage/pages/configuration-guide
